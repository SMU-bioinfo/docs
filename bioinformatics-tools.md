# NicheNet

nichenetr: the R implementation of the NicheNet method. The goal of NicheNet is to study intercellular communication from a computational perspective. NicheNet uses human or mouse gene expression data of interacting cells as input and combines this with a prior model that integrates existing knowledge on ligand-to-target signaling paths. This allows to predict ligand-receptor interactions that might drive gene expression changes in cells of interest.
